Linear Regression in R

Linear regression is a fundamental statistical method widely used to understand and model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In R, linear regression is commonly performed using the lm() function, which stands for "linear model."

These R codes are constructed based on the "Introduction to Regression in R" course on DataCamp, with some modifications and additions. In these R codes, you will see how to apply linear regression to various real-world datasets, such as Taiwan house prices, churn rates in banks, and ad conversions. Through hands-on exercises, you will explore how to fit a simple linear regression model, make predictions from your data, and quantify model performance.
